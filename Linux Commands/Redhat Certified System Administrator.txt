Standard Streams:Standard In,Out and Error:
#########################################################
To print in standard out:
#echo "Hello World"
# ls -ltr /etc/passwd
#cat /etc/passwd
#echo "Hello world,this is to test redirection" > testing,
the output of the echo command will not show on the terminal,it will
redirect to the file "testing".
#history
#echo "Hello world,this is to test redirection" >> testing,it will
append lines to the existing file.
# cat /etc/passwd >> testing

Pipe(|) is used to pass output from one command to another command

Grep: Globally search a regular expression and print
#ls -ltr|grep "o",to search in the output of the ls-ltr command
#grep "o" /etc/passwd

In linux,standard stream: standard in is represented by 0,standard out is represented by
1 and standard error is represented by 2.

#cat /etc/passwd > testing
#sort testing 1> testing_sorted 2> testing_failed,means it will redirect the output to the
testing_sorted file and if it has error,it will redirect to the testing_failed file.
#sort testing01 1>testing_sorted 2>testing_failed
#cat testing_failed,it will show the error output

Access Remote systems using ssh:
#############################################################
Daemon process is a software process.
To connect to the remote server,ssh client need to be installed in source.
sshd process need to run on the targert server.
To check ssh is running or not.
#ssh
#ssh root@X.X.X.X
#ifconfig -a
To check sshd is running or not.
#ps -ef|grep sshd
#ssh root@X.X.X.X
#exit

Passwordless login:
#ls -a,it will show hidden files.
#ls -altr|grep .ssh
#ssh-keygen
#cd .ssh
The public keyfile of the source need to copy to the authorized_keys folder
of the target server.
#scp ~/.sshd/id_rsa.pub root@X.X.X.X:~,~ is home directory
#cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorizeed_keys
#ssh root@X.X.X.X
Need to change mode of the authorized_keys files.
#chmod 600 authorized_keys
to check it is working or not in localhost:
#cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
#ssh root@localhost,it will connect without asking for password, it will
also ensure that sshd is running localhost/source also.

Log in and switch users in multiuser targets:
####################################################
#view /etc/passwd,to check users
#cat /etc/passwd|grep -v nologin
#su - mithun
#su - root
#ps -ef|grep su
#ps -fu
#ps -ef

Archive,Compress,unpack,uncompress files using tar,star,gzip and bzip2
############################################################################
Archive means pack,for backup purposes.
Archive and unpack will be done by tar and star
Compress and uncmpress will be done by gzip abd bzip2
#tar,to check command in there or not
#sudo yum -y intall star
#tar --help
#tar --usage
File which is archived and ziped is named as mithun.tar.gz
To inzip this file:
#tar xzf mithun.tar.gz,x for extract and z for unzip
#du -sh .,du for disk usage,s for summary and h for human readability
#cd ..,to go one directory up
#tar --help
#tar -c,-c to create,-v for verbose,-f for file archive
#tar cvf mithun.tar(will create file in that directory with this filename) mithun/(the directory,which needs to be archived) 
#du -sh mithun.tar
#tar -tf mithun.tar,to check each of the files in the tar
#tar xf mithun.tar

star:secure tar,concern on security
#star -help
#star -c -f mithun.tar mithun/
#star -t -f mithun.tar
#star -x -v -f mithun.tar
#scp -r mithun root@X.X.X.X:/root/
#ls -ltr|wc -l,wc stands for wordcount and -l is used to mention each line will be counted as word.
wc -l means line count
#gzip -h
#gzip mithun.txt,it will compress the file with gz extension.
#cp mithun01.txt mithun.txt,to copy/create mithun.txt file using mithun01
#gzip -f mithun.txt,it will force to create zip file.
#gzip -l mithun.txt,it will list
#gzip -d mithun.txt.gz, it will decompress
#gunzip mithun.txt.gz,same as above command

bzip2 compress file at higher rate as compared to gzip
#bzip2,another compression command
#bzip2 --help
#bzip2 mithun.txt
#bzip2 -d mithun.txt.bz2
#bzip2 -k mithun.txt,-k is used for create,in that case both mithun.txt and newly created mithun.txt.bz2 file will be there in that directory
Generally,after compression,the original file mithun.txt will be deleted automatically.

Creating both tar and zip file at a time:
#tar -cvzf mithun.tar.gz mithun/
#du -sh mithun.tar.gz
#star -help
#star -bz -c -f mithun.star.bz mithun/,-bz is used for bzip2
#star -z -c -v -f mithun.star.bz mithun/
#tar -xzvf mithun.tar.gz
#star -x -z -v -f mithun.star.bz

#Create and Edit Text Files:
###############################################################
vim is more advanced than vi,vim can understand standard keyboard.
#cp /usr/share/doc/man-pages-overrides-7.2.4/wget/COPYING text_demo.txt
#gedit text_demo.txt,it will open graphical interface
#vi text_demo.txt
#touch mithun.txt,it will create an empty file,if file already exists,it will update the timestamp.
